# Non-asymptotic Analysis of Biased Adaptive Stochastic Approximation

## Overview
This repository contains the code and experiments related to the paper "Non-asymptotic Analysis of Biased Adaptive Stochastic Approximation." The paper presents theoretical results on Biased Adaptive Stochastic Approximation and illustrates these results through experiments with deep Variational Autoencoders (VAE). The repository includes implementations of the Importance Weighted Autoencoder (IWAE) and the Biased Reduced Importance Weighted Autoencoder (BR-IWAE), trained with various optimization algorithms such as Adagrad, RMSProp, and Adam on the CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets.
